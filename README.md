### Build With
The project is implemented using the following frameworks and Databases
* [![NestJS](https://img.shields.io/badge/NestJS-Framework-ea2845?logo=nestjs)](https://nestjs.com/)
* ![MySQL](https://img.shields.io/badge/MySQL-4479A1?style=flat&logo=mysql&logoColor=white)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
* ![npm version](https://img.shields.io/badge/npm-v10.3.3-blue)
* ![Postman](https://img.shields.io/badge/Postman-FF6C37?style=flat&logo=postman&logoColor=white)

## Implementation
Steps to implement and set up the project:
1. Clone the repo
    ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/pramod-jay/Tech-Venturas-Assessment-2.git
   ```
    
2. Database Implementation
  <br/>The MySQL database server is hosted on Azure flexible server, eliminating the need for database server implementation locally. Details regarding the database configuration can be found in the <b>‚Äò.env‚Äô</b> file in the root directory.

3. Open the project with a preferred IDE such as VSCode, IntelliJ IDEA.
   <br/>(Completion of successful opening will result in the project with the following folders and files)

4. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
5. Run the servers
    ```sh
    # develpoment
   npm run start
   ```

    ```sh
    # watch mode
   npm run start:dev
   ```

_P.S.: Installation of node modules will be necessary at the initial stage, and it will only require ‚Äònpm start‚Äô command for the rest of the testing._

6. Import <b>TechVenturas.postman_collection.json</b> to the Postman which is in the root folder.

7. Now the environment is ready for testing via Postman.üëè<br/>

## Assumptions
* A gateway requires a name and an IP address.
* Peripheral devices are not mandatory for a gateway; they can exist independently.
* Peripheral devices can also exist without being associated with a gateway.
* If a gateway is deleted, the connected peripheral devices may not be deleted; instead, the foreign keys indicating the devices' connection to the gateway will become null.
